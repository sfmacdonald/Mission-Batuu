# Mission-Batuu
Transmission from Batuu with secret mission details

Leveraging .css code from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PolarNotion/starwarsintro/blob/master/index.html), I created this message as part of a surprise birthday trip to Disneyland for my twin son & daughter's 12th birthday. My wife and I were able to purchase tickets to their special "Disney After Dark: Star Wars Nite" and wanted to make it the best experience possible since they are huge Star Wars fans.

I would like to express gratitude to Polar Notion for building this code and allowing users to utilize it in their projects for free at their [deployed website](https://polarnotion.github.io/starwarsintro/).

Please note that this project is not for any monetary gain and only for the entertainment of my family.
